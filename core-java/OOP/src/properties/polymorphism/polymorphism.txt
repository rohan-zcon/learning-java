Poly means "Many" and morphism means "ways of representing"
types of polymorphism-

Compiled time/static: can be achieved bymethod overloading, which method to run happens at compile time
Runtime/dynamic: can be achieved by method overriding, which method to runs happens at run time

Overloading vs Overriding
They both allow methods to perform different behaviors but same name, supporting polymorphism.
Overloading (at compile time):
    Multiple methods in same class, same name, diff return type or signature
Overriding (at run time):
    Redefining superclass method in subclass with same signature. JVM calls method based on Object type.

UPCASTING:
Basically is typecasting of child object to a parent object. This is done implicitly.
This gives the flexibility of accessing parent class members
but only selective child class members are accessible (like Overridden methods etc)

DOWNCASTING:
Typecasting of parent object to a child object. This cannot be done implicitly.

Example
// Upcasting Vs Downcasting

// Parent class
class Parent {
    String name;

    // A method which prints the
    // signature of the parent class
    void method()
    {
        System.out.println("Method from Parent");
    }
}

// Child class
class Child extends Parent {
    int id;

    // Overriding the parent method
    // to print the signature of the
    // child class
    @Override void method()
    {
        System.out.println("Method from Child");
    }
}

// Demo class to see the difference
// between upcasting and downcasting
public class Demo {

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Upcasting
        Parent p = new Child();
        p.name = "Rohan";

        //Printing the parentclass name
        System.out.println(p.name);
        //parent class method is overridden method hence child class will be executed
        p.method();
        // This variable is not accessible
        p.id = 1;

        // Trying to Downcasting Implicitly
        // Child c = new Parent(); - > compile time error

        // Downcasting Explicitly
        Child c = (Child)p;

        c.id = 1;
        System.out.println(c.name);
        System.out.println(c.id);
        c.method();
    }
}

Java determines which method to call during run-time by a mechanism called, Dynamic Method Dispatch.
The call to a overridden method is resolved at a run-time rather than compile time
